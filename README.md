# LinkedIn-Analytics-CTR

## What it measures

LinkedIn clickthrough rate measures the percentage of users who, after seeing your ad or post, clicked through to your landing page.

It’s calculated by dividing the the number of impressions your post or ad received by the number of clicks.

For example: Say 500 people saw an ad you ran, which in turn earned you 50 clicks to the landing page on your website. You’d divide 50 (number of clicks) into 500 (number of impressions) to get a CTR of 10 per cent. (Aside: With a CTR that high, you’ve clearly done something right. Congrats!)

## Why it matters

If your goal is to drive your audience to a landing page, CTR is the best means of measuring your campaign’s efficiency.

The problem with looking just at counting metrics – clicks or impressions individually – is that they don’t provide enough context to measure performance.

By looking at CTR you can track how successfully you are at getting the audience you’re targeting to take action.

A high CTR means you’re doing a good job.

A low or middling CTR means something is off – your targeting, your offer, even your ad copy.
